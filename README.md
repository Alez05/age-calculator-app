## Overview

Frontend Mentor challenge - Age calculator app

### The challenge

The challange itself given by Frontend Mentor was a great chance for me to refresh my memory using React. I have been working with React for a while now but I have not been using it for a while. This challenge was a great opportunity to get back to React and refresh my memory.

## My process

I started by creating the components and the structure of the project, then slowly i started looking into the variables and build the logic of it, took  me a while to figure out how to do it but i managed to do it. I used the useState hook to store the variables . I also used the onChange event to update the state of the variables. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- React hooks
-


### What I learned

I learned destructuring and using the variablesin a state in a more organised way. I refactor the code for a more clean and readable code. I msotly had a refresh of how react works and how to use useState hook.



### Continued development

I am lookign forward in updating this project with useEffect, I know bits about it but i still need some more information so i can use it for the future.


### Useful resources

- [React documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html) - This helped me for the basics of react. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [React hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand how to use hooks. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
